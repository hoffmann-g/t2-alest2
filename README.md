# About

This project involves implementing a directed graph to solve the problem of finding the longest path in a graph composed of boxes that are directed towards smaller boxes.

The graph is represented using an adjacency list and consists of boxes characterized by their XYZ dimensions.

# Technologies used
- Java for the graph
- Python for generating the box catalogs
- PyDot for rendering the visual representation
